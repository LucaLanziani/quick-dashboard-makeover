# Team Challenge: KitchenOps !!! 

Your team has been recently hired to run your restaurant's KitchenOps program.  The restaurant is so close to its 5th Michelin star, you can taste it!
One way to attain that 5th star is to deliver consistently perfect results in meal preparation.  This means having complete control over:
* Oven, stovetop, and grill temperature settings
* Shelflife of the freshest ingredients (and the soup!)
* Consistency of food preparation times per meal time
* and more.

Being in the 4-star tier, this restaurant has recently invested in IoT telemetry to track these sorts of things, and the restaurant owner's child has already created a set of library panels for these sensors.
All we have to do is present them in a way that is easy for the kitchen staff to understand and attractive enough -  if they were to peek into the kitchen - an anonymous Michelin inspector!
